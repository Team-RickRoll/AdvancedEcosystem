## Current Features:
**Farm Animal Rework**
  - Applies to Cows, Chickens, Sheep, Pigs, Horses, Donkeys, and Rabbits.
  - You will now have to feed your animals every day (configurable)
  - Animals that are not fed will make less farm produce and could die if not fed for long enough.
  - To make it fair, well fed animals will produce more (Ex: 3 porkchops -> 6 porkchops)
  - You can only milk a cow once per day (might be increased)
  - Animals will be able to reproduce at certain age, every certain amount of days (age and days will vary)
  - Baby animals will take ~5 days to mature
  - _To be continued_
